Description about the assignment: Covert global export to global import

https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/product/enduse/imports/index.html

Specific Modifications from original:
1) Change SITC code for import commodities (SITC code differ from export and import commodities)

Possible Future Directions:

There is a pattern in the url based on the country code. Thus would like to automate the process to pull data based on desired country.
